# Discrete-Symmetry-Detection-and-Exploitation-Reinforcement-Learning-
A novel algorithmic implementation to improve the reinforcement learning algorithm, Q-Learning. A set of symmetries form a group (satisfying the axioms required for it to be classified as a group). 

The existence of symmetries is checked in the state-action space and the Q-table's associated values that render the dynamics of the system invariant under such transformation are updated. More on that can be found here: https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611977745.14

The implementation here is on two example environments: Grid World and Planar Viscous Streaming Flow. The latter is a novel dynamical system.
